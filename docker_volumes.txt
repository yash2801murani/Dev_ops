## 🚢 What is Docker Storage?

When you run a container, it creates its own **temporary filesystem**. But:

* When the container **stops** or is **removed**, any data **inside it is lost** ❌.

So, if your app stores files, logs, database data, etc., you’ll lose it unless you use **persistent storage**.

---

## 📦 What is a Docker Volume?

A **Docker volume** is a **special directory** on your host that stores data **outside the container**.

* **Survives container restarts & removal**
* Used for **databases**, file uploads, logs, etc.
* Docker manages volumes for you

## 🧠 Think of it like:

| Component    | Real-life analogy             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Container    | A temporary room              |
| Files inside | Notes written on a whiteboard |
| Volume       | A hard drive outside the room |

If the room (container) is destroyed, notes on the whiteboard are lost. But anything saved on the hard drive (volume) stays.

## 🔧 Common Docker Volume Commands

### 1. **Create a volume**


docker volume create myvolume


> 📌 Creates a named volume called `myvolume`.

---

### 2. **List volumes**

```bash
docker volume ls
```

> 📌 Shows all existing volumes.

---

### 3. **Inspect a volume**

```bash
docker volume inspect myvolume
```

> 📌 Shows where the volume is stored and other details.

---

### 4. **Use a volume in a container**

```bash
docker run -d -v myvolume:/app/data myimage
```

> 📌 Mounts `myvolume` to the `/app/data` folder **inside the container**.

Anything written to `/app/data` in the container is stored **in the volume**.

---

### 5. **Remove a volume**

```bash
docker volume rm myvolume
```

> 📌 Deletes the volume (only if not in use).

---

### 6. **Remove all unused volumes**

```bash
docker volume prune
```

> 🧹 Cleans up volumes not used by any container.

---

## 📁 What about bind mounts?

Besides volumes, you can **bind a host folder** directly to a container:

```bash
docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container myimage
```

Example:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data myimage
```

> ✅ Useful for development — changes on your computer appear in the container.

## 📌 Summary: Volume vs Bind Mount

| Feature      | Volume    | Bind Mount        |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| Managed by   | Docker    | You (host path)   |
| Portability  | High      | Low               |
| For Dev use  | Sometimes | Often             |
| For Prod use | ✅ Yes     | ❌ Not recommended |
